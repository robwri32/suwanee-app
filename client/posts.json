You may have picked up this issue because you were enticed by that delicious looking pizza on the cover. Well, trust us, not only does it look delicious – but it tasted great too! Yes, we got to try the best pies from nine Suwanee pizza shops. We have a tough job, right? Selecting a winner was actually a lot harder than you’d think though – we discovered that Suwanee has some really great pizza! From mom &amp; pop pizza shops to well-known chains, our judges and staff diligently critiqued each slice based on crust, cheese, toppings, sauce, taste, creativity and overall impression. The competition was stiff, but only one could be crowned champion. Flip to page 43 to find out whose tasty creation came out on top!</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In our wedding section you will find information from local vendors and a heart-warming story about soon-to-be-married couple, Dede and Stephen. Dede is currently fighting Stage 2, Grade 3 Breast Cancer – while she is also planning a September 2016 wedding. Dede reached out to local radio station, The Bert Show, to see if they could give her some insight on venues to check out. But, they went far beyond just that! They shared Dede and Stephen’s story on-air and the community quickly rallied behind them to help pull off their dream wedding by donating everything from a venue to music, food, cake, photos, video, a dress, linens, favors, and more! When I heard that they are getting married at Four Oaks Manor in Buford, where I got married last year, I decided I had to meet Dede. I met her and her wedding planner, Summer McClane, at one of Dede’s Chemotherapy sessions at Piedmont Cancer Center in Atlanta. Throughout Dede’s treatment, Summer often met her at the hospital, as a way to help Dede get her mind off cancer and to have something to look forward to as they planned out her special day! Dede is one of the sweetest, most grateful people I’ve ever met and I can’t imagine somebody more deserving of their dream wedding. We can’t wait to see photos of the beautiful wedding in September!</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Two local sisters are also doing their part to help fight cancer…. one cup of lemonade at a time! Turn to Page 30 to learn about sisters, Marisa and Savannah’s lemonade stand with a cause! We hope to see you stop by their annual lemonade stand too on July 16th in the River Plantation neighborhood. We hope you have as much fun reading this issue as we had putting it together! Summer is in full swing, so soak it in before the craziness of back-to-school ensues in August. My own craziness is about to begin in August when we welcome our own little bundle of joy into the world. Wish me luck as I venture into the crazy world of parenthood!</p>\n"

The marketing team at Veugeler Design Group was in attendance at the 2016 Digital Summit Atlanta – the regions largest gathering of digital marketing industry leaders and are pleased to bring you some key takeaways regarding the latest in digital marketing.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Email Marketing is (Still) Huge</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://suwaneemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/MarketingImage.png\" rel=\"facebox\" onclick=\"return TrackClick('http%3A%2F%2Fsuwaneemagazine.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F06%2FMarketingImage.png','')\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-11183\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-11183\" src=\"http://suwaneemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/MarketingImage-172x130.png\" alt=\"MarketingImage\" width=\"172\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"http://suwaneemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/MarketingImage-172x130.png 172w, http://suwaneemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/MarketingImage-768x581.png 768w, http://suwaneemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/MarketingImage-529x400.png 529w, http://suwaneemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/MarketingImage-520x394.png 520w, http://suwaneemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/MarketingImage.png 1258w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 172px) 100vw, 172px\" /></a>Email marketing is alive and well – it’s simply moved from desktop to mobile. There is a lot of power in a well- crafted email and one thing is for sure, businesses can directly connect to their clients, past and current, through an email campaign. First thing’s first, always legitimately acquire your email lists, never purchase a list and do not mass email those you don’t have permission to. Sending email to an address that has not opted in to your list can hurt you more than help. Mail clients such as MailChimp and Constant Contact can suspend your account &#8211; making it difficult to bounce back when that happens. By crafting a purposeful email and sending it to the right email addresses within your list, it can be well worth the return. Don’t be afraid of people unsubscribing, it’s worse to end up in spam. Offer a customer the option to reduce the amount of emails they receive or receive emails by topic instead of unsubscribing completely.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>2. Video Goes Beyond YouTube</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Customers want to put a face to a name and video is a perfect way to make that happen. Recording a video can <a href=\"http://suwaneemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DigitalMarketing.png\" rel=\"facebox\" onclick=\"return TrackClick('http%3A%2F%2Fsuwaneemagazine.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F06%2FDigitalMarketing.png','')\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-11186\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-11186\" src=\"http://suwaneemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DigitalMarketing-133x130.png\" alt=\"DigitalMarketing\" width=\"183\" height=\"179\" srcset=\"http://suwaneemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DigitalMarketing-133x130.png 133w, http://suwaneemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DigitalMarketing-768x751.png 768w, http://suwaneemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DigitalMarketing-409x400.png 409w, http://suwaneemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DigitalMarketing.png 886w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 183px) 100vw, 183px\" /></a>feel intimidating for those who are not comfortable on camera, but there are ways to ease that tension. Bright lights, green screens and a lot of people watching can cause anxiety, so make it a simple process. Have one person with a simple camera, and use natural lighting to make for a more comfortable setting. Video can be very powerful and reassuring if you’re struggling to sell a “ boring” product or if customers feel uncomfortable in the buying process. When a video is accompanied with a product online, purchases are up to 30% more likely to happen. So, put yourself and your product out there and reap the benefits.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>3. Customer Service is Going Social</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Many companies are offering social media as an alternative to calling and speaking with a representative. Although some customers still want to speak with a person directly to resolve an issue or issue a complaint, millennials especially will take their concerns to the internet first, particularly through social media. One speaker at the conference made the claim that customer service will be completely social within the next two years. Yes, you read that right, two years! Many companies are already taking that step; take Humana Insurance for example &#8211; their &#8216;contact us&#8217; page makes it easy for you to get in touch with them by any of their five social networks. They even encourage you to tweet at them for service. A good rule to remember is to handle negative comments privately by inviting the customer to direct message you and keep positive comments public.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>4. Think Bigger, Braver, Bolder</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Engaging content is more about brains than budget. Your story is what sets you apart. So how do you tell that <a href=\"http://suwaneemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ResponsiveWebsite.png\" rel=\"facebox\" onclick=\"return TrackClick('http%3A%2F%2Fsuwaneemagazine.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F06%2FResponsiveWebsite.png','')\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-11184\"><img class=\"wp-image-11184 alignleft\" src=\"http://suwaneemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ResponsiveWebsite-116x130.png\" alt=\"ResponsiveWebsite\" width=\"139\" height=\"156\" srcset=\"http://suwaneemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ResponsiveWebsite-116x130.png 116w, http://suwaneemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ResponsiveWebsite-356x400.png 356w, http://suwaneemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ResponsiveWebsite.png 513w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 139px) 100vw, 139px\" /></a>story? Smart companies do it through content. Smart companies don’t follow trends, they lead them. Bigger context means putting your business into the lives of your audience. Bolder marketing allows you to tell a different story than your competitors. Braver perspective asks who is your company and why do you do what you do? To get the creative juices flowing, ask yourself, if you cover up your logo, would you recognize your company? Focusing on your story and how it relates to your customers helps you build an audience and become a leader in your industry.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>5. Social Media Shouldn&#8217;t Simply Be A Footnote</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Social media is here to stay &#8211; even if you don’t think your business needs it or you believe it’s a fad &#8211; it’s time to reevaluate your online marketing strategy. The user-generated content on social media is invaluable &#8211; it’s where your customers are and where they talk about their favorite brands, products and companies, share information and perform research prior to a purchase. Your business doesn’t have to be on each and every social media platform that’s out there. If you’re new to social media, start with one platform at a time. For a company offering a professional service, that could be LinkedIn, or for a retail business, Instagram may be the best option. Social media is a great place to start a conversation with your current and potential customers; we also encourage you to experiment with social media advertising for an added bang for your buck. Facebook ads can be relatively inexpensive and very targeted to your unique or niche audience.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>6. Updating/ Redesigning Your Company&#8217;s Website</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If a website update is needed for your company, it will more than likely include one or all of the following: 1) A content management system (CMS) change 2) Changing the URLs for your site 3) A redesign of the site, a domain change or moving to a secure site (SSL.) If you need to make more than two of these changes to your company website, give yourself 30 to 60 days in between these changes. Doing more than two of these at a time can have an adverse affect on search engine optimization as well as become overwhelming for your web team and confusing to your customers.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Use these takeaways as a guideline for the remainder of your 2016 marketing program and keep them in mind when planning for next year. <strong>Contact Veugeler Design Group for help on implementing one or all of these tactics for your company or business.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n"

That is why on Sunday, July 24th, M4 Hair Studio will be opening their doors to deserving young women, grades 6-12, for complimentary back- to-school haircuts during their inaugural “Beauty and Soul” event. Melanie partnered with Buford City Schools to invite 75 girls-in-need to participate in the event. The school system’s Social Worker hand-selected the girls that she felt could use the self-esteem boost and a day of pampering that they might not otherwise have.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Melanie and her staff are going above and beyond to ensure that this is a day these young women will always remember. Nail Society Salon &amp; Spa in Buford will also be setting up complimentary manicure stations inside M4 Hair Studio for the girls during the event. Other businesses in the community and clients of M4 have stepped up to donate goodies for “beauty bags” and treats like cupcakes for the day. “This community has literally opened its arms for me ever since we opened in December of 2014,” said Melanie. “I just really wanted to do something to give back to the community that has been so good to us,” she continued. With four hairdressers on staff, M4’s hands will be full that day, so they are looking for licensed hairdressers who might be interested in volunteering their time to help give haircuts that day. <strong>They are also looking for volunteers to help keep the event running smoothly by assisting with check-in, set-up and breakdown, etc. If you are interested please register at this<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"> <a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"http://www.signupgenius.com/go/4090d45a4a92aa4fd0-beauty\" onclick=\"return TrackClick('http%3A%2F%2Fwww.signupgenius.com%2Fgo%2F4090d45a4a92aa4fd0-beauty','link')\">link</a>. </span><span class=\"s1\">If anyone is interested in donating goodies for the beauty bag, please contact M4 Hair Studio at 404-784-5521. </span></strong></p>\n"

With grilled foods, the pairings are quite close to what you would expect from everyday fares: whites, reds and rosés. But there are some amazing wines that aren’t to be missed this summer! In the tradition of steaks and burgers, Malbecs are the way to go. These wines are usually stainless steel fermented, (unless noted as a Reserve) and have wonderful fruit qualities that will compliment red meats in any capacity. These wines are also very budget friendly, ranging from $8.99 and up, meaning having a few extras on hand wouldn’t hurt just in case friends drop by. One of the biggest sellers in this category is <b>Gascon Malbec, a very modestly priced wine that over delivers and has been ranked as a “Best Buy” for several vintages. Kaiken Malbec is another one not to be missed. </b>This young Malbec has a dark, inky color with notes of strawberries and dark cherries followed by very silky tannins. Pair this one with ribs, or brisket topped with your favorite sauce.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Lake Wines</strong></span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_11253\" style=\"width: 90px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://suwaneemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WineCan.png\" rel=\"facebox\" onclick=\"return TrackClick('http%3A%2F%2Fsuwaneemagazine.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F06%2FWineCan.png','')\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-11253\"><img class=\"wp-image-11253\" src=\"http://suwaneemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WineCan-76x130.png\" alt=\"WineCan\" width=\"80\" height=\"137\" srcset=\"http://suwaneemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WineCan-76x130.png 76w, http://suwaneemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WineCan.png 222w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Alloy Pinot Noir</p></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">For those days when you need to be one with nature, lake excursions can be a little tough, especially for wine lovers. Traditionally, wine comes in glass bottles, a no-no for time in a boat or on a pier. The technology of containers has evolved dramatically in recent years, taking these situations in mind. Wine-maker, Andrew Jones of Field Recordings set off on a one-man journey to solve this problem for wine and lake-lovers around the globe. Currently in production are the <b>Pinot Noir, and the Grenache Rose’</b>, both offered in 500ml cans &#8211; <i>gasp! </i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">While the beer world has taken massive steps to gear consumers towards cans, the wine world won’t be far behind. These two wines are outstanding offerings that beg to be taken with you to the lake, festivals, on the trail, picnics, and anywhere else the summer takes you. Not only are the cans lighter weight, they’re easier to recycle than glass.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Pool Wines</strong></span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_11254\" style=\"width: 66px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://suwaneemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/banshee21.png\" rel=\"facebox\" onclick=\"return TrackClick('http%3A%2F%2Fsuwaneemagazine.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F06%2Fbanshee21.png','')\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-11254\"><img class=\"wp-image-11254\" src=\"http://suwaneemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/banshee21-38x130.png\" alt=\"banshee21\" width=\"56\" height=\"191\" srcset=\"http://suwaneemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/banshee21-38x130.png 38w, http://suwaneemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/banshee21-117x400.png 117w, http://suwaneemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/banshee21.png 479w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 56px) 100vw, 56px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Banshee Rose</p></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">For those sun-bunnies that will be residing by the pool for the remainder of the summer, Rosé wines and anything with bubbles are the way to go. <b>Villa Jolanda, a producer from Italy, makes a line of sparkling Moscatos with all-natural fruit infusions like Mango, Pineapple, Strawberry, and Peach. </b>These are amazing alone, but throw in a shot of peach schnapps, or triple sec to not only kick up the flavor, but up the ante on alcohol content as well. Freezing fruit and dropping it in your glass not only looks fancy, but keeps your beverage colder longer. If bubbles aren’t your thing, try a dry Rosé from Provence or California. Provence has been producing Rosés that are known globally for being light bodied, flavor intense wines; but California is rapidly closing the gap, producing more of their own each year. <b>Banshee Rosé of Pinot Noir, has the palest color of pink, but as much complexity as you would expect from Sonoma. </b>Chilled, this wine disappears fast, so make sure you procure multiples. Try this wine with a nice fresh salad or fresh fruit parfait.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Alloy Pinot Noir</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Grapes:</strong> Pinot Noir Wine <strong>Region:</strong> Central Coast <strong>Style:</strong> Californian Pinot Noir <strong>Country:</strong> United States <strong>Food Pairing:</strong> Veal, Pork, Game (deer, venison), Rich Fish (salmon, tuna etc), Poultry</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Alloy Central Coast Grenache Rosé</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Grapes</strong>: Grenache Noir Wine <strong>Region:</strong> Central Coast <strong>Style:</strong> Californian Pinot Noir <strong>Country:</strong> United States <strong>Food Pairing:</strong> Beef, Mature and Hard Cheese</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Kaiken Malbec</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Grapes:</strong> Malbec <strong>Wine Region:</strong> Mendoza <strong>Style:</strong> Argentinian Malbec <strong>Country:</strong> Argentina Beef, Spicy Foods, Mature and Hard Cheese, Poultry</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Villa Jolanda Moscato &amp; Peach</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Grapes:</strong> Moscato <strong>Wine Region:</strong> Asti <strong>Style:</strong> Northern Italy White <strong>Country:</strong> Italy <strong>Food Pairing:</strong> Sweet Desserts</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Gascon Malbec</span></strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Grapes</strong>: Malbec <strong>Wine Region:</strong> Mendoza <strong>Style:</strong> Argentinian Malbec <strong>Country:</strong> Argentina<strong> Food Pairing</strong>: Beef, Spicy Foods, Mature and Hard Cheese, Poultry</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">*Whatever your summertime adventure is, make sure to stop by Beverage Superstore.
